# BreastCancerDetection
This is a Jupyter Notebook file that uses machine learning techniques to detect breast cancer in patients. The notebook uses the Winsconsin Breast Cancer Dataset to train and test the machine learning models.

# Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the Jupyter Notebook file on Google Colab, where you can run the code and experiment with the machine learning models.

## Prerequisites
You will need to have a Google account and access to Google Colab.

- Running the Notebook on Google Colab
- Go to Google Colab.
- Click on the File menu and select Open Notebook.
- Click on the GitHub tab.
- Enter the GitHub repository URL https://github.com/setu-glitch/BreastCancerDetection/ and select the Jupyter Notebook file.
- Click on the Open in Colab button.
- The notebook will open in Colab and you can run the code cells by clicking on the Run button or using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Enter.
